plotMElm
======================

A simple R package to plot marginal effects from interactions estimated
from linear models.

# Examples

## Continuous Term 2

The package contains one simply function: `plot_me` for plotting marginal
effects from interactions estimated from models estimated with the
`lm` function in base R. For example, when the second term is continuous:

```{r murder-me-example, fig.path="tools/"}
# Load package
library(plotMElm)

# Estimate model
states <- as.data.frame(state.x77)
m1 <- lm(Murder ~ Income * Population, data = states)

# Plot marginal effect of Income across the observed range of Population
plot_me(m1, 'Income', 'Population')
```

## Categorical (Factor) Term 2

When the second term in the interaction is a categorical (factor) variable then point-ranges are plotted. Note that the marginal effect is in terms of the 
reference category:

```{r cars-example, fig.path="tools/"}
# Set Term 2 as a factor variable
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl, 
                     labels = c('4 Cyl', '6 Cyl', '8 Cyl'))

# Estimate model
m2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt * cyl, data = mtcars)

# Plot marginal effect of Weight across the Number of Cylinders
plot_me(m2, 'wt', 'cyl')
```

Note that point ranges will also be used if there are five or fewer fitted values.

## Determining the False Positive Rate

[Esarey and Sumner](http://jee3.web.rice.edu/interaction-overconfidence.pdf) 
show that pointwise confidence intervals from marginal effect plots produce 
statistically significant findings at a rate that can be larger or smaller 
than is warrented. `plot_me` allows users to specify `ci_type = 'fdr'` to find
confidence intervals that correct for overly confident marginal effects in the 
face of multiple comparisons. FDR stands for "False Discovery Rate". For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Plot marginal effect of Income across the observed range of Population
# with false discovery rate limited confidence intervals
plot_me(m1, 'Income', 'Population', ci_type = 'fdr')
```

Here is the result compared with standard confidence intervals:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.path="tools/"}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
p1 <- plot_me(m1, 'Income', 'Population') + ggtitle('Standard CI')
p2 <- plot_me(m1, 'Income', 'Population', ci_type = 'fdr') + 
            ggtitle('FDR Limiting CI')
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

You can also use the `t_statistic` argument to supply custom t-statistics
for creating the marginal effect confidence intervals. This is useful if you 
want to use a funciton like `findMultiLims` from the 
[interactTest](https://cran.r-project.org/package=interactionTest) package to find t-statistics 
that can be used to correct confidence intervals for underconfidence.

The [interplot](https://cran.r-project.org/package=interplot) package also has 
some of the same capabilities as **plotMElm**.
